# Bible Util

BibleUtil is a fork of [D-Haven/BibleUtilities](https://github.com/D-Haven/BibleUtilities) that I'm modifying to meet my specific needs. It's a work in progress. You should use the original project instead.

Completed changes:
* Make book order public, so it can be used as an ID field
* Removed Norwegian language support. It would be difficult for me to support with the changes I plan to make.

Planned changes:
* Streamline abbreviations, and add more
* Add apocryphal/deuterocanonical books
