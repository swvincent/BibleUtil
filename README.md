# Bible Util

BibleUtil is a fork of [D-Haven/BibleUtilities](https://github.com/D-Haven/BibleUtilities) that I'm modifying to meet my specific needs. It's a work in progress.

Completed changes:
* Make book number (order) public, so it can be used as an ID field
* Allow book only references. Chapter is 0 if none specified.
* Add ContiguousVerses property to Reference
* Removed Norwegian language support as I'm unable to support it with the changes I plan to make.

Planned changes:
* Streamline abbreviations and add additional abbreviations
* Add apocryphal/deuterocanonical books
